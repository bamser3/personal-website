            Ever since I was <b>graced</b> by the knowledge of their existence I have been 
            infatuated by the infinite potential we as humanity have obtained by playing 
            with electrical signals <b>(aka, computers)</b>, from the most <b>primitive</b> binary switch,
            to the supercomputers' that power our world as we know it today.

            Using that as my drive to <b>learn</b>, <b>develop</b> and <b>implement</b> solutions to problems
            I experience, and express myself through <b>applications</b>, <b>designs</b> and <b>projects</b> that support my <b>hobbies</b> or <b>Lifestyle</b> with code.
